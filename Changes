=item 0.06-dev
Copied from the mod_perl 1 core for an independent CPAN release.
[Philip M. Gollucci <pgollucci@p6m7g8.com>]

Added support for using Linux::Smaps (on Linux only, obviously) to
get much more accurate shared memory numbers on 2.6.x kernels. Taken
from Apache2::SizeLimit.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>

Added support for using Linux::Pid to get the parent pid on
Linux. This fixes a long-standing bug that caused this module to never
actually kill a process when using Perl 5.8.1+ on Linux.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>

Lots of work on the docs.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>

When calling C<setmax()>, C<setmin()>, and C<setmax_unshared()>,
only add Apache::SizeLimit as a cleanup handler once, not once for
each function call. Taken from Apache2::SizeLimit.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>

Deprecated direct use of globals to set memory limits.
